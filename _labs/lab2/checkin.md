Before leaving the lab, check in with a TA and tell them you and your
partner's answers to these questions.

1. Using the sample Makefile in the lab writeup, trace what happens when you issue `make` with no
   command-line arguments: what does `make` try to build? How does it
   determine what actions to take?

2. Identify two new test cases you could add to `testing.c` that would verify whether `is_odd` returns the appropriate true/false result for negative numbers. What result would you expect if both your tests cases pass? What if one or both fails?

3. The segments on the 7-segment display are
   labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
   Which of those segments would you turn on
   to generate a "0", a "1", a lowercase "D"?

Don't forget to return all tools to the shelves & leave your workspace as clean as you left it!
