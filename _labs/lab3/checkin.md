1. If you take the saved `pc` in the stack frame for `main` and subtract it from the saved `lr` in the stack frame for `diff`, what do you get? Express your answer as a number, then explain conceptually what that computation represents.

2. Why will loopback mode only work if you plug in both `TX` and `RX`?

3. Running bare metal on the Pi as we do, there is no circumstance under which an invalid call to `strlen` (e.g. argument is an invalid address or unterminated string) has a visible bad consequence at runtime. Why not?
