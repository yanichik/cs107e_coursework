CS107 is the third course in Stanford's introductory programming sequence.
CS106 provides students with a solid foundation in programming methodology and
abstractions, and CS107 follows on to give you the skills needed to build
computer systems. The course will start with the microprocessor and move up to
the C programming language, without skipping anything in between. The goal is
to build a solid understanding of all aspects of how modern computers execute
programs and how program development tools work.

Topics covered include:

  -   the ARM architecture
  -   assembly language and machine-level code
  -   the C programming language
  -   compilation, linking and loading
  -   debugging
  -   memory organization and management
  -   controlling peripherals: GPIO, graphics, sound, and keyboards

__CS107e__ is an experimental approach that teaches the fundamental concepts of
computer systems through bare metal programming on the Raspberry Pi. Bare metal
programming means you will not run an operating system on the Raspberry Pi and
will make minimal use of libraries. This course also serves as an
introduction to embedded systems.

This class is organized by weeks. Each week consists of two lectures
on Fri and Mon, a lab offered on Tue or Wed evening, and a programming
assignment which is due the following week. Lecture and lab attendance is mandatory. You'll finish the quarter by completing a final project of your own design. There are no exams.

Readings will be assigned from a variety of sources, including *The C
Programming Language*, Kernighan and Ritchie.
