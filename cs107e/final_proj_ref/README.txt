This folder contains code from past CS107e students' final projects or assignments
that we think you might find useful. As of 12/1/18, it is provided as-is and untested
by the course staff, though we can attest that it was useful to the students who
provided it to us.

Refer to the README.txt in each folder for more info on the specific
code, although note that these were provided without documentation so the READMEs
will not be very specific. As more people use and improve upon these libraries,
we can build up the documentation.

If you find bugs and fix them, come up with additional documentation, or write
your own libraries that you think others might find useful, please send them our way
and we can update this folder with your code!
