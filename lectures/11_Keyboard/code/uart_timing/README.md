This application is a simple UART driver, adapted
from the hello application in the Serial lecture.
The purpose is to show how the timing of bits changes
as you change the baud rate (using a logic analyzer),
and so when communication starts breaking down.

Note it uses a non-standard UART module that lets
you set the baud rate.
