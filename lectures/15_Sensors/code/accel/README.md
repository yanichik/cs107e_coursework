MinIMU-9 v3 Gyro, Accelerometer, and Compass (L3GD20H and LSM303D Carrier)
https://www.pololu.com/product/2468

A minimum of four connections are necessary to use the MinIMU-9:
VIN, GND, SCL, and SDA. 
- SDA is GPIO_PIN2
- SCL is GPIO_PIN3

VIN should be connected to a 2.5 V to 5.5 V source GND to 0 volts,

SCL and SDA should be connected to an IÂ²C bus operating at the same
logic level as VIN.

(Alternatively, if you are using the board with a 3.3 V system, you
can leave VIN disconnected and bypass the built-in regulator by
connecting 3.3 V directly to VDD.)
