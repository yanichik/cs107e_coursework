/*
 * hall effect sensor 3144.

 *
 *
 * looking down from the top of the pyramid = power, ground, output (vout).
 * 	- vout to gpio2.
 *	- enable pullup so don't need a resistor.

 *
 * The output of these devices (pin 3) switches low when the magnetic
 * field at the Hall element exceeds the operate point threshold (BOP). At
 * this point, the output voltage is VOUT(SAT). When the magnetic field
 * is reduced to below the release point threshold (BRP), the device
 * output goes high. The difference in the magnetic operate and release
 * points is called the hysteresis (Bhys) of the device. This built-in
 * hysteresis allows clean switching of the output even in the presence
 * of external mechanical vibration and electrical noise.
